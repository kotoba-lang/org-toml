(ns toml.reader
  "[TOML v1.0.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) as a reader, in portable `.cljc`,
  with no dependencies.

  A hand-written recursive-descent scanner over a character index. TOML is
  small enough that a parser combinator library would be more code than the
  grammar, and this stays a leaf.

  ## What a document becomes

      table              a Clojure map, string keys
      array              a vector
      string             a string
      integer            an integer
      float              a double, with :inf/:-inf/:nan for the named values
                         (⚠ ClojureScript has one numeric type, so `1.0`
                         reads back indistinguishable from `1` there. That is
                         the host, not this reader; do not build a wire format
                         on the difference.)
      boolean            true / false
      offset date-time   {:toml/offset-date-time \"1979-05-27T07:32:00Z\"}
      local date-time    {:toml/local-date-time \"1979-05-27T07:32:00\"}
      local date         {:toml/local-date \"1979-05-27\"}
      local time         {:toml/local-time \"07:32:00\"}

  Keys stay strings because TOML keys are strings and may contain anything;
  keywordising them would lose `\"a.b\"` and `\"\"`, both of which are legal.

  The four date-time types are tagged rather than parsed into an instant.
  TOML's local types have no offset, so there is no instant to produce, and a
  reader that invented one would be making a timezone decision on the
  caller's behalf. `kotoba-lang/time` is where that belongs.

  ## Errors

  Returned, never thrown. `read` answers `{:status :ok :value m}` or
  `{:status :error :reason kw :line n :column n}`. The reason keywords are
  contract."
